      <h2>About Cocker spaniel</h2>

      <p>
        The English <em>Cocker Spaniel</em> is a breed of gun dog. It is noteworthy for producing one of the most 
        varied numbers of pups in a litter among all dog breeds. The English Cocker Spaniel is an active, good-natured,
        <strong>sporting dog</strong>standing well up at the withers and compactly built. There are "field" or "working" cockers
        and "show" cockers. It is one of several varieties of spaniel and is the foundation of its American cousin,
        the American Cocker Spaniel. 
        The English Cocker is closer to the working-dog form of the Field Spaniel and the English Springer Spaniel.
